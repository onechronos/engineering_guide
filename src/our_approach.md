# Our Approach to Engineering

Before getting into the specifics of the software that we build, let's first discuss how we build it. Key tenants include:

* Rigorous Domain Driven Design
* Polyglot pragmatism
* Anti bikeshedding tools and standards
* An approach to testing that emphasizes formal methods, property testing, and end-to-end testing
* A rejection of methodological development practices, e.g. scrum

The above isn't a magic recipe for writing software in general. It's a recipe for writing the types of software that powers OneChronos. OneChronos views technology as a core differentiator. We operate within a highly competitive landscape but have two key advantages over incumbents:

* The ability to build systems blank slate, unencumbered by forty years of legacy
* An order matching paradigm that's highly amenable to architectures that enable superior latency characteristics, richer business features, and a lower TOC

These key advantages can help us outmaneuver and outcompete institutions far larger than ours.
