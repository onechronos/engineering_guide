# The Agile Industrial Complex

The core tenants of agile are good ones. That said, the agile practices that most stakeholders encounter in the wild are what Martin Fowler refers to as faux agile, the use of which drives the [Agile Industrial Complex](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agile-aus-2018.html). Frustrations with heavyweight development processes gave birth to agile. Ironically, most companies that practice agile are in reality practicing something heavyweight, and far from it.

As we've already discussed how collaboration, communication, and process is key to building systems. What we don't like about faux agile is two fold:

1. Its heavy emphasis on fine grained resource planning and structure around meetings
2. The intermediation of engineers and stakeholders via project managers

Caveat emptor: our arguments for why both of these are bad is highly situational. What holds true for development at OneChronos does not hold true in general.

Agile's use of extensive task/resource based planning is a key driver of its adoption at companies that view software development as a cost center. Viewed through that lens agile gives the business transparency into where money is going and who to blame when projects go sideways. Most companies fall into the "software is a cost of doing business" camp, and the Agile Industrial Complex has grown strong as a result.

The use of project managers that are neither domain experts nor engineers writing code is something to avoid whenever possible. PMs are invaluable at companies where navigating the org structure or fighting for resources is itself a full time job. They're also invaluable when there's a culture of separating product owner roles and engineering roles to the point that engineers don't understand what the product does/why it exists and product owners don't have a clue how the sausage gets made.

When that's not the case, "project management for the sake of project management" is never a good thing. At best it's overhead. At worst it's another opportunity for introducing modeling errors as engineers and product owners play telephone through an intermediary.

OneChronos believes that the highest velocity product development possible comes when the domain experts themselves build systems, and having developers work directly with domain experts via a tight feedback loop is a fast second. We also believe that while system level planning is invaluable (ergo the strong emphasis on DDD), the value of time and resource based planning is dubious when stakeholders are economically aligned and on the "same team."

We believe in this strongly enough that it informs our decisions on hiring and corporate structure. Building product in this fashion requires a strong emphasis on keeping teams small, making every hire count, investing heavily in developing employees, and keeping incentives aligned. Almost every iconic company for which tech was the core differentiator started with this philosophy and worked to preserve it for as long as possible. Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Intel are notable examples.
