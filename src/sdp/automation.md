# Automation > Documentation

High level instructions for building, running, and deploying a project are great. What's not great is an elaborate formula for doing so, presented in text form. Instead of writing out instructions, script a process. This could involve writing a Makefile, an Ansible playbook, or a Terraform module. When done properly, build/install/deploy scripts serve a dual purpose: documenting in a structured way while simultaneously automating laborious and error prone processes.
