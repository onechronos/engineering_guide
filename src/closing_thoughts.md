# Closing Thoughts

We should live in a golden age for computers and software engineering. Cloud computing, automated devops, a growing emphasis on developer tooling, and increasingly sophisticated programming languages and frameworks have made it easier than ever to engineer software that's correct, performant, and easy to evolve.

Instead, by most measures, we live in a dark age. The Agile Industrial Complex, bloated frameworks, anemic mainstream programming languages, and culture that makes Silicon Valley the comedy seem like a documentary all contribute to that. The result is a software engineering process that's cumbersome, and software that's often underwhelming. Computers are capable of incredible feats of performance that most end users don't get to see. Instead, what most people see are systems that are [perceptually slower than they were forty years ago](https://twitter.com/gravislizard/status/927593460642615296).

Both the good and the bad parts of the software engineering status quo is great news for OneChronos. Our business will succeed on the basis of our ability to make and market software that seems like magic to end users. Embracing a unique, purpose driven approach to engineering is a big part of that.
